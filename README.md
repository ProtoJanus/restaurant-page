# restaurant-page

## Description

I created this site, using vanilla javascript, html and css, and a bundler called webpack. I am dynamically creating the pages using javascript, the distribution build only has one html file, and uses javascript to dynamically render the homepage, the menu, and the contact form. I use javascript modules and classes for code encapsulation. Hosted [here](https://protojanus.github.io/restaurant-page/).
